# Lets learn some Haskell for great success!
This is my place to work through the _Learn You a Haskell for Great Good_ book,
which is available [here.](http://learnyouahaskell.com)  
  
So far, it's just some basic stuff in the `src/` directory, but that will 
change as time goes on and I progress further. At the moment, most work is done
via the interpreter using GHCi (Glasgow Haskell Compiler interpreter).
